			<p><em>My Educational Journey</em></p>
		</div>
		<span class="container-text">
			<h3>Born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, I grew up in one of the <strong>lowest performing school districts</strong> in the US.</h3>
			<p><em>I saw firsthand how the education system sorts students into separate tracks based on their backgrounds and early achievements.</em></p>
		</span>
		<span class="container-img clark"></span>
		
		<span class="container-img healy"></span>
		<span class="container-text">
			<h3>Like many high-achieving students, I set my sights on an <strong>elite college.</strong> </h3>
			<p><em>I went to Georgetown University, where I built an appreciation for values-based education that cares for the whole person. All the while, I struggled with the amount of wealth, privilege, and homogeneity that dominated the school.</em></p>
		</span>
		<span class="container-text">
			<h3>Now in a Master's in Learning Design and Technology, my focus is on designing programs that <strong>expand access</strong> to higher education.</h3>
			<p><em>Meanwhile, I work at the Office of Advancement, which raises funds for scholarships.</em></p>

		<div class="column-project">
			<h3>A transformative vision</h3>
			<p>I believe that education is a public good for all. Instead of forcing people to sit in on monotonous lectures while taking on thousands in debt, schools should equip people with what they need to live fulfilling lives.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column-project">
			<h3>Harnessing technology thoughtfully</h3>
			<p>Rather than blindly adopting the next shiny tool, education must proactively seek the technology that help it better meet its students' and community's needs.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column-project">
			<h3>Human-centered, health-conscious</h3>
			<p>Education is more than just teaching skills to future employees. It's about creating a civic society, teaching morals and healthy habits, and addressing global and local issues.</p>
